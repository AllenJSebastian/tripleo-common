    The default plan deployment workflow now automatically adds the necessary
    certificate and key to enable TLS by default in the overcloud. Note that
    this doesn't overwrite any certificate or keys given by the deployer;
    those still take precedence. This will enable TLS if it isn't already
    enabled though.
